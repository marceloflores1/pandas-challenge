Pandas Homework - Pandas, Pandas, Pandas

For this assignment we were requiered to choose between two Challenges and I decided to do both for practice. 

1. Heroes Of Pymoli. 

The objective is to analyze the purchasing data for the most recent fantasy game of Heroes of Pymoli. 

We start with a csv_file and we should read the data and break it down into meaningful insights:
- Player Count
- Purchasing Analysis (Total)
- Gender Demographics
- Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
- Age Demographics
- Top Spenders
- Most Popular Items
- Most Profitable Items

There is a jupyter notebook that uses Pandas and Dataframes to solve this and the final report is displayed while running the code and includes Conclusions at the end. 

2. Py City Schools

The objective is to analyze two files containing Student and School information and look for trends while calculating the following:
- District Summary
- School Summary
- Top Performing Schools
- Bottom Performing Schools
- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size
- Schore by School Type

There is a jupyter notebook that uses Pandas and Dataframes to solve this and the final report is displayed while running the code and includes Conclusions at the end.
