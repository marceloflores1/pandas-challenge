For this assignment we were requiered to choose between two Challenges and selected Option1: Heroes Of Pymoli. 

The objective is to analyze the purchasing data for the most recent fantasy game of Heroes of Pymoli. 

We start with a csv_file and we should read the data and break it down into meaningful insights:
- Player Count
- Purchasing Analysis (Total)
- Gender Demographics
- Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
- Age Demographics
- Top Spenders
- Most Popular Items
- Most Profitable Items

There is a jupyter notebook that uses Pandas and Dataframes to solve this and the final report is displayed while running the code.
